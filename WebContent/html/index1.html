	I'm trying to create a website loosely based on the first CSS lesson (webfundementals lesson 7) to make sure I can program a website outside of codecademy.com. The HTML sheet works fine but for whatever reason it's not linking to the css document. The current link is the css file is named style.css both the html and css files are on the desktop. I'm using the ConTEXT text editor to write the code Any advice I can receive would be much appreciated.
